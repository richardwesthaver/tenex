This crate is required by the modules generated by
[`async-google-apis`](https://github.com/dermesser/async-google-apis). Once
linked, it takes care of the dependencies used by the generated code.

Make sure that the modules you are using are at compatible versions of the ones
used here. If this is a problem, you can remove the crate import from the
generated code and supply your own dependencies instead, or store a modified
copy of the crate and depend on the local copy.

Note that for some macros to work, you still need to add the following
dependencies to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
serde = "~1.0"
```
